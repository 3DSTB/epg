    <desc lang="en">First in a two-part documentary in which Gareth Malone takes on a new challenge - to form a choir of wounded ex-servicemen and women to perform at the Invictus Games in May. He begins by meeting Prince Harry, the founder of the games, then sets out on his search to find 12 singers, each of whom has a story to tell of the struggles they have faced since medical discharge. Once together, there follows three days of singing lessons, where Gareth soon realises he has to learn a new way of working with such a fragile group. However, the song he chooses for them triggers unexpected emotions.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Gareth's Invictus Choir</title>
    <desc lang="en">First in a two-part documentary in which Gareth Malone takes on a new challenge - to form a choir of wounded ex-servicemen and women to perform at the Invictus Games in May. He begins by meeting Prince Harry, the founder of the games, then sets out on his search to find 12 singers, each of whom has a story to tell of the struggles they have faced since medical discharge. Once together, there follows three days of singing lessons, where Gareth soon realises he has to learn a new way of working with such a fragile group. However, the song he chooses for them triggers unexpected emotions.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">First in a two-part documentary in which Gareth Malone takes on a new challenge - to form a choir of wounded ex-servicemen and women to perform at the Invictus Games in May. He begins by meeting Prince Harry, the founder of the games, then sets out on his search to find 12 singers, each of whom has a story to tell of the struggles they have faced since medical discharge. Once together, there follows three days of singing lessons, where Gareth soon realises he has to learn a new way of working with such a fragile group. However, the song he chooses for them triggers unexpected emotions.(n)</desc>

He begins by meeting Prince Harry, the founder of the games, then sets out on his search to find 12 singers, each of whom has a story to tell of the struggles they have faced since medical discharge. Once together, there follows three days of singing lessons, where Gareth soon realises he has to learn a new way of working with such a fragile group. However, the song he chooses for them triggers unexpected emotions.(n)</desc>

In the Maldives, Simon finds arguably the most beautiful collection of tropical coral islands in the world - but the fragile underwater environment is a barometer for the changing nature of the sea, as he witnesses how bleaching has damaged the coral and an entire island has been manufactured as a landfill dump to deal with the problem of rubbish.(n)</desc>

During that period, the station was key to the discovery of the Ozone Hole, and today it is making vital findings about how people's lives are vulnerable to the Sun's activities, as well as studying interplanetary travel and the threat of man-man climate change. In addition to returning to the place he once called home, Peter is on a rescue mission, since the station is under threat of being cast adrift on a huge iceberg.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Mary Beard's Ultimate Rome: Empire Without Limit</title>
    <desc lang="en">English Classical scholar Mary Beard explores the myths and revolutions of the Roman Empire, looking at it with an epic scope, and gives her own personal take on the world-defining period. In the first edition, she gains an insight into the deep-rooted psyche of the people of Rome, looks at the expansion of the city, and travels to Greece, where Rome adopted a complex mix of brute force and cultural cringe, and France, where she finds evidence of war methods akin to genocide.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Indian Ocean with Simon Reeve</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">Oman to the Maldives.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The fourth leg of the adventurer's journey takes him from Oman to the Maldives. He starts in the Strait of Hormuz, where oil from the Gulf is shipped through the narrow channel, then moves on to Mumbai, the ocean's biggest port. In the Maldives, Simon finds arguably the most beautiful collection of tropical coral islands in the world - but the fragile underwater environment is a barometer for the changing nature of the sea, as he witnesses how bleaching has damaged the coral and an entire island has been manufactured as a landfill dump to deal with the problem of rubbish.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">BBC weatherman Peter Gibbs makes an emotional return to the British Antarctic Survey's Halley Research Station, where he lived and worked in the early 1980s. During that period, the station was key to the discovery of the Ozone Hole, and today it is making vital findings about how people's lives are vulnerable to the Sun's activities, as well as studying interplanetary travel and the threat of man-man climate change. In addition to returning to the place he once called home, Peter is on a rescue mission, since the station is under threat of being cast adrift on a huge iceberg.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Long Lost Family</title>
    <desc lang="en">Inge Dart, 66, grew up in Kenya in the dying days of the British Empire, overshadowed by her domineering mother. After becoming pregnant at the age of 19, she was sent halfway around the world to give birth in secret. Banished to Surrey, she was taken in by a couple who looked after her until her daughter was born. Inge's childhood sweetheart Jeremy soon visited and the young lovers spent what little time they had with their baby. Long Lost Family takes on Inge's search for her child and, in a first for the programme, her daughter's own search for her father Jeremy. Davina McCall and Nicky Campbell present.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Tony Robinson and the team brave freezing weather to explore Chapel Hill on the windswept expanse of the East Anglian Fens. Flint axes and ornately carved stone blocks discovered by the landowners suggest a religious building or prehistoric monument once stood on the small Cambridgeshire outcrop, while other theories about the location's history include a Bronze Age burial ground and a lighthouse. However, the first day of the dig produces evidence the site is even older than the archaeologists expected.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Ben and Rachel Hammond have spent a year searching London for somewhere exciting to live with their two daughters, and they have finally stumbled on a 1950s home on a unique plot, situated within the leafy depths of a park in the south of the city. The only problem is the house itself - an ugly, inefficient and uninspiring property - and their solution is to radically transform it into a sleek, modernist masterpiece. But this is no easy task, as Kevin McCloud finds out.(n)</desc>

This 10-bedroom Italian-inspired residence is home to Cornelia and her 12 cats, and is also said to be one of the most haunted houses in Wales. Cornelia is desperate to generate income to restore the Grade I listed building to its former glory, so Hayley and Dann have agreed to spend five days cleaning alongside her, pushing their boundaries and challenging their germ phobia.(n)</desc>

James Corden invites Jamie Redknapp, Jack Whitehall and Andrew Flintoff to take part in an adventure across America and compete in a series of challenges, with the overall loser having to strip on stage with the Chippendales.

    <title lang="en">Room to Improve</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jean Robinson and Daithi Elliffe seek the help of architect Dermot Bannon to turn a listed 19th-century former schoolhouse at Kilternan, which has scenic views of the Dublin mountains, into their ideal family home. The property has been virtually disused for the past 30 years and is dank and dilapidated, with rotting floors, and the new homeowners are seeking a comfortable and bright dwelling with a modern layout. However, despite a generous budget of 360,000 euros, the constraints of a protected structure, a tight schedule and hidden costs begin to take their toll on the project.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jean Robinson and Daithi Elliffe seek the help of architect Dermot Bannon to turn a listed 19th-century former schoolhouse at Kilternan, which has scenic views of the Dublin mountains, into their ideal family home. The property has been virtually disused for the past 30 years and is dank and dilapidated, with rotting floors, and the new homeowners are seeking a comfortable and bright dwelling with a modern layout. However, despite a generous budget of 360,000 euros, the constraints of a protected structure, a tight schedule and hidden costs begin to take their toll on the project.(n)</desc>
